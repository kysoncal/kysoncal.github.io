## E1: UI Basics Technical Essay

To be completely honest, the idea of doing something such as WODS seemed almost duanting, but this came with the complete unknowingness of what a WOD is. With the deadline of BrowserHistory1 creeping up in three days, I decided to forge into this venture. To my surpise, I had almost a complete understanding of what the instructions were and how to execute them. I then looked at BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3 and found them to be much easier than the first. With that being said, I wanted to have a specific approach when completing the WODS, and that was to try it out on my own (despite the risk of spending a long time doing so) first followed by recording. 

With BrowserHistory1, it took me around thirty minutes to complete the WOD on my own. This was due to the plethora of tags I could have chosen, but with my prior knowledge of HTML/CSS from ICS 101, this challenge was easier than intially thought. I was able to record the first try and proceeded to submit it right away.

With BrowserHistory2, it was much easier than the prior, and I believe this is due to only modifying the CSS sheet. It took me around fifteen minutes to complete it on my own. I then proceeded to record two times because I felt like my time could be much lower, which ended up happening.

With BrowserHistory3, I did find some confusion at first only because I did not review the material to do thoroughly enough. I did end up watching the screencast first to see how the instructor did it, and decided to review what he did first to fully understand the commands. After doing so, I spent around an hour and ten minutes trying to complete it on my own, which did take a considerably huge amount of time, but it was worth it. I was able to record and submit it successfully.

My advice is to always do the WOD first (sound really cliché, I know). It's always important to apply the material you learned hands-on as this is a class to do so. If you become stuck, it's ok to do a simple search or to refer to your notes. Either way, refreshing your knowledge is always a healthy thing to do. Once you complete the WOD with your time, try and see if it is possible to decrease your time. With this method, it challenges you to think and apply your findings evem faster, which contributes to a better learning experience.
