## Why I Chose MIS

My path to becoming an MIS major wasn’t very clear. I came to the university as a declared B.S. Biology candidate with hopes of becoming a cardiologist. Long story short, it was not the best turn I took. I did very well in my first semester, earning a 3.5 GPA, but the second semester was filled with failing grades and a desire to change majors and careers. I knew that if I continued as a Biology major, I would end up depressed and empty. When I switched to Exploratory Business, I instantly became happier, and it reflected in my grades and outlook on life. I was able to earn great grades and experiences as an Exploratory Business student. When it came to deciding my major, I initially thought Marketing would be the best choice since I have had great opportunities in creative media creation since high school. However. taking ICS 101 was an ultimate game changer. I heard countless rumors about ICS 101 and how it was a fail-prone course. I did choose to believe it, but I chose to view it as motivation to not be like the “rest.” I passed the class with flying colors, gained valuable technical skills, and received an offer to become an Assistant Teaching Assistant for the ICS 101 course. I know serve as an ICS 101 Lab Assistant, and it has been such a great experience helping out students with topics I am very interested in and willing to expand my skills in. That is when I discovered that Management Information Systems was the best fit for me and my goals. The intersection between business and technology is quite astonishing, and I believe it will be easily applied to whatever field I may enter whether it be marketing, accounting, or even healthcare administration.
