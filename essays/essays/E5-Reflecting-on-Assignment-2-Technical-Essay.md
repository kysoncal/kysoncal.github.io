## Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
With Assignment 2, we were required to build upon our Assignment 2 by enforcing a login and registration page for users and new users to utilize. We were taught how to implement various functionalities and codes to make sure that all of our HTML pages are seamlessly integrated with our JavaScript code.

## What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned so much from this assignment. I learned to transfer data across multiple pages and also learned how to implement a login and registration form with a process that validates whether or not it matches the criteria I had put out. I also learned the importance of time management because staying up all night figuring things out was not exactly the greatest idea.

## Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I worked by myself. 

## How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I utilized ChatGPT tremendously for this assignment as well as assignment 2 and my friends in the class. I also used W3 schools. Most of the problems revolved around my query string and quantities not transferring to my login, registration, and invoice. When the original due date was in place, that was the problem that stressed me out the most. When I asked GPT, it gave me pure nonsense. With the help of my friend, we were able to solve my problem in 30 minutes. I wished I asked Dr. Port for help, retrospectively.

## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
Developing this assignment included process forms and new pages, as well as data validation for the login and registration processes. With assignment #1, we were required to build from scratch. With assignment #2, we had to build upon with respect to our existing code. This made it harder (for me, at least) since code may have discrepancies, resulting in errors and difficulties. 

## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I spent 30% thinking about how to do something, 40% writing code, and 30% testing/debugging

## Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
What worked well was the creation of the login and registration pages. I enjoyed creating it to match my website theme and being able to implement validation code (especially for my IR) was quite an entertaining experience. What did not work well was my problem with the query string as well as my time management.

## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back in time, I would ask Dr. Port for more help as well as start earlier. I was so proud of my assignment #1 that I took a break for a while. I should have started right when assignment #1 was done.
