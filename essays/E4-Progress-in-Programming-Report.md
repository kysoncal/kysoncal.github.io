## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
My programming skills have improved quite a bit since the start of the semester. My understanding of concepts that were once abnormal to me seem to be normal, which is very good in my opinion. The art of practicing and repetition combined with the material this course presents allows me to be much more detail-oriented while making sure I understand the material that I am learning. I can read and analyze code more effectively while hitting the benchmarks set by this class. As of now, I feel comfortable using the software we use like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am also better at utilizing my resources to help me answer questions. While I have a lot to improve on, I can consciously say that I am at a good place right now.

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
I think the biggest challenge that this class presents to me is the correlation between client-server and JavaScript. I also need to improve my code structure, ensuring that wherever I decide to place my code has a reason to be there. To conquer my biggest challenge, I just have to diligently review those topics using the resources available to me already while also doing some outside research.

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I indeed have learned a lot from the WODS, and while I still struggle with finding solutions on my own, I can say that I donâ€™t rely on the screencasts as much. At first, I would watch the screencast even after the slightest bit of confusion. Now, I am able to complete them after reviewing what the WOD requires through past lessons and outside research.

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs have definitely helped me throughout this class, which is a given considering that labs is what we do during class. All the labs have been a big help in terms of the preparation needed for Assignment 1. While I end each lab with a confused mind, considering we have to complete the last exercise on our own with a bunch of readings to do,  going back to it every week helps me understand it more. 

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
Assignment 1 was an enriching experience considering I was able to apply all the material we have been learning this past semester into this one project. While I dealt with confusion and roadblocks almost every time I opened VS Code, being able to refer to past labs and other resources helped me to become an independent learner and to take initiative when it comes to my education. I feel ready to tackle Assignment 2. 

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I think the class can be improved by allowing peer reviews and to establish a more collaborative environment amongst students. I am a firm believer in peers helping each other out and that there are cases where we can learn more from like-minded individuals by solving issues as a team.  

## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
What helps me the most in class are WODS and working with classmates. WODs are a great way to establish a firm understanding of material by completing tasks on our own, by ourselves. Like I mentioned before, I think working classmates is an experience that every college student should go through, and doing so for me, personally, is a great way to expand my knowledge while keeping a social aspect that I desire.
