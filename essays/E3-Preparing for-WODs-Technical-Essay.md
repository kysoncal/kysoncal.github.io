## Invoice 1 WOD

The last WOD I completed was the Invoice 1 WOD. For this WOD, we had to dynamically create an invoice receipt with information concerning a variety of products including their prices. We utlizied expressions, variables, commenting, and Javascript. If you want to read more instructions about this WOD, click [here! (https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html)] 

My experience performing the WOD was quite steady. Everything pretty much worked well for me except changing the "numbers" for the different variables. I do remember using RegEx, which expedited my WOD time by changing the "numbers" quickly. I also stumbled on the placement of the script tags but after practice, it came out to be much easier.

I usually prepare diligently for WODS. I read the required instructions and materials beforehand. If I recognize weak spots, I took the time to review material in hopes of turning my weak spots into strong spots. I also attempt to perform the WOD cold. This allows me to think about what I have to do and to see if I have enough base-knowledge to perform without reviewing. It almost acts as a temperature check for me, which has proven to be successful in my experience.

Going off of my experience, I want to review RegEx to utilize in future WODS and projects.
