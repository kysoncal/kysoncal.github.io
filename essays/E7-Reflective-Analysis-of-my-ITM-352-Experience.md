## Course Objectives Review
# 1.1 Building Foundational Programming Skills in IT
The course began with an introduction to HTML, progressing to more complex topics like JavaScript, encompassing variables, functions, and data structures. Advanced features such as file I/O and sessions were incorporated into our major assignments. This structured learning path culminated in the creation of a functional, albeit imperfect, e-commerce website where users can manage purchases and view invoices.

### 1.2 Recognizing the Importance of Programming in MIS
In MIS roles, understanding the interplay between various systems and technologies is crucial. The assignments enhanced my grasp on how essential programming skills are for tasks like system integration, debugging, and infrastructure development. Particularly, Assignment 2 allowed me to experience firsthand the integration challenges and solutions in creating seamless user interactions.

### 1.3 Hands-On Software Application Development
Assignments 1 and 2 provided practical experience in developing functional e-commerce platforms. Starting from a basic template, I learned to build and customize complex functionalities. The process highlighted the challenges and intricacies of software architecture and user interface design, particularly in ensuring smooth operation and user experience.

### 1.4 Solving Real-World MIS Problems
Addressing MIS issues often involves unique solutions tailored to specific scenarios, as evident in the diverse approaches my peers and I took in our assignments. Learning to comment and meticulously review code was a valuable strategy in troubleshooting and refining our projects.

### 1.5 Learning Project Management and Collaboration
Collaboration was essential in navigating the complexities of programming assignments. Peer support played a critical role in overcoming challenges, particularly in understanding and utilizing tools like Google Cloud. The experience underscored the importance of teamwork and communication in tech environments.

### 1.6 Boosting Confidence in Problem Solving
The course was a rigorous exercise in enhancing my analytical and problem-solving capabilities. As the semester progressed, so did my confidence, particularly through collaborative lab sessions and the iterative process of testing and refining code.

## Course Elements and Personal Engagement
Creating a professional portfolio was an invaluable exercise in documenting and reflecting on my coursework. It served not only as a personal archive but also as a resource for future students. The process of preparing and sharing essays added depth to my understanding, while WODs helped solidify my knowledge by requiring detailed explanations of my coding decisions.

Quizzes, though brief, provided a preview of upcoming lessons, creating "aha!" moments during subsequent labs, which deepened my understanding of the material. The labs themselves were not just about achieving objectives but understanding the underlying mechanics of each task.

## Challenges and Achievements
The pace of new programming concepts was intense, with only a week allocated to each, demanding significant time and dedication. The unexpected challenge of a cracked computer screen further complicated my ability to complete assignments, a logistical hurdle that was particularly disruptive during critical project phases.

Despite these obstacles, the creation of a functioning e-commerce store was a standout achievement, highlighting my growth in both technical skills and resilience.

## Skill Development and Application
The course structured our learning through three progressive skill levels: syntactic, algorithmic, and application. Each stage built on the last, culminating in a comprehensive ability to not just understand but also apply complex programming concepts in practical scenarios.

## Use of AI Tools
While AI tools like ChatGPT boosted my productivity by providing quick solutions and explanations, they occasionally led to reliance issues, reducing my engagement with deeper problem-solving. However, they were also invaluable for debugging, helping to identify errors I might have overlooked.

## Future Implications and Professional Growth
The skills acquired in ITM 352 are broadly applicable in my future career, preparing me for complex project management and problem-solving in any MIS-related role. The technical proficiency gained, alongside soft skills like persistence and time management, will serve me well across various industries and challenges.

This reflective analysis not only captures the essence of my journey through ITM 352 but also underscores the practical and theoretical benefits of the coursework, setting a foundation for my future academic and professional endeavors.
